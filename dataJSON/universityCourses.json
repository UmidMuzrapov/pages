    "name": "CSC 346, Cloud Computing",
    "grade": "A",
    "description": "This course focuses on cloud programming, with an emphasis on using the cloud to solve Big Data problems. The course will not only look at how distributed systems, databases, networks, etc. are used to implement cloud computing platforms and cloud applications, but also the impact of the infinite scalability and pay-as-you-go on the platforms and applications."

    "name": "MATH 223, Vector Calculus",
    "grade": "A",
    "description": "Math 223 Vector Calculus (4 semester credit hours) The course covers differential and integral calculus of functions of several variables. Topics include vector valued and scalar functions, partial derivatives, directional derivatives, chain rule, local optimization, double and triple integrals, the line integral, Green's theorem, Stokes' theorem and the Divergence theorem. Examinations are proctored."

  {
    "name": "MATH 313, Introduction to Linear Algebra",
    "grade": "A",
    "description": "An algorithmic approach to solving systems of linear equations transitions into the study of vectors, vector spaces and dimension. Matrices are used to represent linear transformations and this leads to eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The precise use of definitions plays an important role. Examinations are proctored. This course is required in the math major and prepares students to take Math 323. It is a prerequisite to the majority of the higher level courses in mathematics."
